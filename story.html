        <p>
            <br>There was no noise. 
            <br>Silence reigned over this room.
            <br>Dust dwindeled down ever so slowly from the ceiling and softly settled onto the floor and furniture. 
            <br>The room was lit with a soft amber glow, comming from the sole lamp hanging from the low ceiling above the old, withered, dark oak table. 
            <br>Only the centre of the chamber was correctly lit, the rest was dimmed heavily by the thick sheepskin lampshade.
            <br>
            <br>                In a corner, an arm chair made of a heavy dark-green and brown cloth. Tarnished old oaken feet stood steadfast in a still carpet of age-old dust. Time had not been gentle to the chair, as the cloth was starting to unraffel and was still barely holding any of its color. 
            <br>Neither had Time been gentle to the man sitting in the chair.
            <br>Gazing out the dark window, arms resting on the armrests, booted feet steady on the floor. Skin as yellow and brittle as parchement, hair almost none existent. There seemed to be only one thing alive about this person. 
            <br>His eyes glistened in the low light, peering out the window, into the dark night. There was nothing to see but void and blackness. No garden, no street, not a single soul passing by. Only Time seemed to be ticking silently away. 
            <br>
            <br>    There was nothing left to wait for. Everything had come, and now everything had gone. Not a single cel in his body could fathom the idea of moving from that chair. He'd just have to wait. He couldn't care less. His body felt warm, even if it was just the idea of warm he felt. His body was probably numb, but that he couldn't care to think of. He was just waiting. Staring out the window. Hopes and Dreams all went and came, and had been gone away for ages now. 
            <br>He blinked. 
            <br> Eons passed as he peered into the void. Galaxies and planets passed by the window as time flew by.
            <br>His eyes moved a bit to the right. A spider crawled down from the window still and disappeared into a little crevice in the wall. 
            <br>
            <br>“Hello” ? 
            <br> A familair voice echoed damply troughout the chamber. 
            <br>For the first time in ages, he moved. Startled by the soft female tones of the call, his feet twitched and his head turned toward the door. Dust flew up gently and scattered around the chair. He stood up and put his face against the cold window glass. His breath fogged up the window as he was trying to peer into the dark toward the door that was impossible to see from the angle the window was at. There didn't seem to be a person in front of the door either. There was nothing but empty darkness. 
            <br>He turned around and ran to the door, putting on hand on the door, and the other on the handle. 
            <br> “Who's there ?”
            <br>His voice trembled. He sounded slightly angry. He hadn't talked for ages. He cleared his throat and asked again:
            <br>“Excuse me, who's there ?”
            <br>Noone answered. 
            <br>He let go of the door. Stared at it for a while. It was covered in dust. The print of his hand was visible in it. The handle shined brass again too, now that the dust had gone and stuck to his hand. He rubbed his hand on his pants to get it off. 
            <br>Hesitantly he turned around, walked up to the table and sat down. He took a slow look around the room. He sighed.
            <br>“There used to be a time where this room was full of life you know.”, he said to himself.
            <br>“Remember when you were here?”
            <br>He looked trough the window again, as if he expected someone to show up, then to the door, and then back to the chair.
            <br> “Your hair used to get me all kinds of crazy... Crazy rusty red as it was, it was hard to not notice you, you know.”
            <br>He looked at the table surface and swepped his arm gently across the surface. Dust whirled up and obscured the light for a moment, before revealing a carving on the surface of the table.
            <br>A single tear welled up and soflty ran down his cheek. 
            <br>“Remember when we used to dance here ? When we made love on this table ? Remember when we were drunk and acted as if we were a young stupid couple carving our names in a tree ?”
            <br>He quickly stood up and slammed his hands on the table. 
            <br>“DO YOU ?! DO YOU REMEMBER ?!”
            <br> He took the table and pushed it over, screaming over the effort and the frustration of his memories. Dust flew up and filled the room completely. The lamp swinging violently from left to right, illuminating the room as if a watchtower was peering its light trough the window at an alarming rate. 
            <br>He fell down on his knees , eyes wide open to the ceiling, screaming his lungs out.
            <br>“IVE TRIED MY BEST AND YOU KNOW THAT !! WHEN WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE ?! ”
            <br>He bend over forward and slammed the ground with his fists. 
            <br>Bitter tears rolled down his cheeks, onto the dust covered floor.
            <br>
            <br>    The dust settled down. A ceiling lamp was lighting the room irregularly, softly swaying from side to side. A man was sitting in an old armchair, starting trough a window into pure blackness and void. 
            <br>
            <br>                There was nothing left. The few footsteps that were made would soon fade into the carpet of dust again, and the table was put up straight again. There never was anything here for him. There never would be anything here for him. Yet he stayed. It was all he knew, and ever wanted to know. 
            <br>
            <br>Dust dwindeled down ever so slowly from the ceiling and softly settled onto the floor and furniture. 
            <br>Silence reigned over the room.
            <br>There was no noise.
