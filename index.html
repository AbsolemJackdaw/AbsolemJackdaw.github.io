        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            <br> Absolem Jackdaw,
            <br> My online handle.
            <br>My real name is Axel. Derived to Absolem.
            <br>Jackdaws hold a fond memory of my grand-pa when I was just a couple years old.
            <br>My grand-pa was the one who explained all the workings of the animal kingdom to me.
            <br>It peaked my interest and sparked my early studies towards Animal Care.
        </p>
        <p>
            Those came abrubtly to an end however when my family moved to France when I was 12.
            <br>I ended up falling to the creative side of life in our new home. Drawing was one of my favourite pass-times.
            <br>I try and keep track of my drawings on <a class ="dark" href="https://www.deviantart.com/absolemjackdaw">DeviantArt</a>,
            but most of my drawings just stay in a map on my desk.
            <br> I studied Cinema-Audio-and-Visuals for three years, and attended art school for two years after those before deciding
            these forms of art weren't what I was after. Eventhough Contemporary Art isn't my thing, I did manage to expand my knowledge on composition,
            organisation and colors, a skill that would prove to be useful in a plethora of other facets of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Troughout these years, I had been trying to make board games for years as a pass-time activity untill I got my hands on a
            sub-par virtual game maker to try and explore my creative bounds in the worlds of video games. The medium of the virtual world was
            all that more appealing to me, and was driven by my early interest in video games: games I had discovered trough friends.
            <br> Fruitles however, the year of comming would be 2010.
            Minecraft was getting a name, and with it came, created by the community, a modloader.
            I had my first taste of programming with Java.
        </p>
        <p>
            What follows next is a stream of mods that come and go. 
            <br>The first ones didn't hold much ground, but soon got some traction due to me being able to occupy both the programming end of mod, as well
            as the visual end of the mod. Being able to cover both options and end up with a vial product, and a great pass-time, I kept at it.
            <br>The mods that have survived untill now can be accessed trough the main menu on top, or the cards on the bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have equally experimented trying to make something that should ressemble a game, a framework to make simple 2D games on and a small program 
            that could keep track of user defined Strings for statistic purposes.
            <br>But the time had come. I recently quit my then job, and it was time for me to turn this hobby into a job.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2021 I enrolled in the VDAB's Switch2IT program and joined the PXL University in Hasselt to make a career switch to IT.
            My main focus will stay on Java, but I'll be learning Python, SQL (and non sql) databases and how to interact with these, Spring, HTML fundementals and
            working with GNU Linux.
        </p>
