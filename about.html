I have no fear of these.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1uvqtfo">Over time I have been able to learn to live with them to my own rhythm. The issues build up when the outside
        is concerned.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-e4pgre">We&#39;re on our way to try and become our best selves.</p> <br> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-my7vz4">For those who wonder where the nickname comes from, here&#39;s the explanation:</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1lfovv3">Absolem is a derivative of the etymology of my birth-given name. It&#39;s the only handle I like so far.
        I&#39;ve went trough a handful of handles over the years, but none of them resounded with me. They were bound by
        definitions of myself that people gave me.
        Absolem is my own name, just a little bit encrypted.</p> <br> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ejl5a6">The jackdaw part comes from my favourite bird. It&#39;s tattooed on my chest today.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1oq8ybr">One of my friends asked me : &quot;A jackdaw? Really? They&#39;re scavangers!&quot;</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-qty9qu">It&#39;s not the scavanger part. It&#39;s what the bird represents.</p> <br> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1dvhyyx">I&#39;ll never forget the day my parents dropped me and my brothers off at my grandparents. We stayed the night, and
        the next morning me and my grandpa were looking out the window.</p><br> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-p7spwh">I loved the man. I still do. He had so much knowledge about nature, and I still love that today.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1jq1d7o">It was a winter morning. It was cold out. We could barely see across the street from the big window. But we
        could see a couple poles and the barbed wire from across the street.</p><br>
    Silence befell as we observed the cold day when a jackdaw landed on top op one of the poles that delimited the
    field.<br> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1fivs0h">He told me all about the jackdaw, about their white head and how we could recognize them by it from other black
        birds.
        Some memories are not made to die trough time. The old man awoke a flame in me; a love for nature and detail
        that I carry with me to this day.</p><br> <hr class="h-px my-8 border-cyan-700 border-1 dark:border-cyan-400 mx-10"> <h3 class="font-bold" data-svelte-h="svelte-amwjez">What are your plans for the future ?</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-4i2tkh">I want to continue creating, preferably with Minecraft as a means, and gather people with the same vision to
        start a
        programming band.

        house.
        But
        I just want a place to work where I&#39;m comfortable and happy.</p> <br> <h3 class="font-bold" data-svelte-h="svelte-z6hvcn">Did you study anything to become the awesome person you are today?</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1vje6wo">Don&#39;t flatter me! No I didn&#39;t for a long time. Mainly self thought with a curiosity drive for the next
        step.
        Starting 2021 I did take up studies to try and get a bachelor degree in software development as a full
        stack
        dev at
        the PXL University at Hasselt.
        As of currently I do not have a bachelors yet. If I had more drive for new technologies in the past, I
        could
        have
        learned what they gave me by myself, but
        I can&#39;t deny that in the three years I went there, I have learned a lot. It equally gave me the image of
        selfworth I
        was looking for for ages. I feel like my knowledge is legit now.</p> <br> <hr class="h-px my-8 border-cyan-700 border-1 dark:border-cyan-400 mx-10"> <br> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1vhgroj">If you have any questions, inqueries or want to know more about my work, me or my environement, feel
